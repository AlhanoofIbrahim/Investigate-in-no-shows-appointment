# Investigate-in-no-shows-appointment
The Dataset working on is about No show appointments for 100K patients in Brazil for 3 months with 14 variable that indicates information about the patients we will see the details in the profile report. The main question of the dataset is Why do patients miss their scheduled appointments?

Some of the questions that will be exploring in this analysis are:

The most Age of people that they take care of themselves?
Who is considered to be careful to attend for their appointments Male or Female?
Does the SMS Message is a good reminder?
Does the education effect on the people who are come?
Which of the months have the most number of patients attendees?
Does Alcohol have any effect on coming or not?
